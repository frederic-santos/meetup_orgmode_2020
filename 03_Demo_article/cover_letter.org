Dear Dr. Marcos Martinón-Torres and Dr. Robin Torrence,

Dear Editorial Board of the /Journal of Archaeological Science/,

\bigskip

Please find herewith my manuscript entitled ``DSP2 method is so damn' cool!'', which I am submitting for publication in your journal as a Joke article. 

Some recent research articles have proposed methodological advances for sex estimation using the human os coxae (*insérer refs ici*), but as you will see, my article is much better.

\bigskip

I look forward to hearing from you. 

Yours sincerely,
 
Frédéric Santos
